# SimpleTrack

This is the repository for our paper [SimpleTrack: Understanding and Rethinking 3D Multi-object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09621). We are still working on writing the documentations and cleaning up the code. However, we have already moved all of our code onto the `dev` branch, so please feel free to check it out if you really need to delve deep recently. We will try our best to get everything ready as soon as possible.
